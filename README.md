# NeverFound

This is my entry for the 2020 js13k Javascript game jam.

You are an archaeologist who has found the crypt of Phor-oh IV, an ancient king long lost to history.  According to the recently deciphered ancient text that led you to the crypt, it contains a locked room with a vast treasure.  

The game is inspired by the old Atari game "Haunted House", where you could only see the player's eyes in the dark.  It uses the [Ga game framework](https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga), and it uses [ZzFX](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX) for all the sound effects.  I made the sprites with Piskel.

Feel around in the dark to find the key, then feel along the walls to find the door.  The key and door will be in a random location each time you play the game.  Press P when the startup screen is up to play a game in normal mode.  Press C to play in challenging mode (if you are a Coil subscriber).  Control the player with the arrow keys.  When you find the key, you will here a sound, and a key icon will appear in the lower right screen, and you can then open the door.  Bump against the walls with the arrow keys to find the door.  The door will make a different sound when you bump into it.

The extra challenge mode for Coil subscribers will have an extra ghost to dodge with its own speed.  The other ghosts will also start out faster.
